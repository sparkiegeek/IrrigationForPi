summary: Irrigation an lighting controller for Raspberry Pi
description: |
  Pi-gation is a web app designed to allow you to control external lighting
  and irrigation systems from a mobile device.

  The app allows you to configure Pins on the Pi to control various devices
  such as Lights and Valves for an irrigation system.

  In theory the app can be used to control any device attached to a Pi
  but it has specific interfaces that are fashioned around configuring
  irrigation and lighting system.
